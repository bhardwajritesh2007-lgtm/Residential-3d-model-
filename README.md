# 🏠 3D House Modeling

## 🛠 Software Used
- AutoCAD

## 📌 Objective
The objective of this assignment is to create a *3D house model* from a *2D floor plan* using essential *3D modeling commands* in AutoCAD such as *Presspull, Union, Subtract, and Intersect*.  
This project helps in understanding the conversion of 2D drawings into realistic 3D models.

2. *Create Doors & Windows*
   - Use proper dimensions and positions.
   - Openings are created using subtract command.

3. *Add Blocks*
   - Insert standard blocks like doors, windows, and furniture if required.

4. *Change Visual Style*
   - Switch to Conceptual / Shaded / Realistic view for better clarity.

5. *Convert 2D to 3D*
   - Use *Presspull* to give height to walls.<img width="1920" height="1080" alt="Screenshot 2026-01-04 215525" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0845b30a-0cae-4999-9188-2faac7dfd21d" />

   - Use *Union* to combine solids.
   - Use *Subtract* for doors and windows.
   - Use *Intersect* where required.
